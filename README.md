# My Keybindings

The MODKEY is set to the Super key (aka the Windows key).  I try to keep the
keybindings consistent with all of my window managers.

| `MODKEY + RETURN` | opens terminal (Kitty is the terminal but can be easily changed) |
| `MODKEY + x` | opens run launcher (rofi (random) is the run launcher but can be easily changed) |
| `MODKEY + SHIFT + c` | closes window with focus |
| `MODKEY + SHIFT + r` | restarts awesome |
| `MODKEY + CTRL + q` | quits awesome |

| `MODKEY + d` | minimize focused window  |
| `MODKEY + CTRL + d` | restore recent minimize window |

| `ALTKEY + SHIFT + RightArrow` | Resize window to Right side  |
